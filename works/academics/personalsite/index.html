			<p class="sectionend">So what happened? That's a critical question that's honestly difficult to explain. The lesson is worthwhile, but somehow complex and with more variables than I anticipated. What that means is a long story. I'm not about to dismiss it, but I hope you brought coffee.</p>

			<p>Maybe it's just me, but I making this site made me realize that portfolios can be an incredibly humbling experience.</p>
			<p>When I first sat down to start work on this site, and perhaps more importantly my updated portfolio, I figured it would be easy. I made a digital portfolio back in 2016 to get into a Yearbook class of all things. For 17 year old me, I found it to be pretty impressive. It had a fair amount of works in it, the works were of respectable quality, and everything was done for academics. For the application, it fit the bill nicely. I'd say so at least, given that I got a seat in the class and commendation for my application despite signing up past the deadline.</p>
			<p>But it came before a time I learned to do make a site from scratch. It was a Weebly drag-and-drop, and as drag-and-drops often go, it seemed to lack a truly personal feel no matter how much I tried to deviate from the prebuilt template. I felt a yearning for a change.</p>
			<p class="sectionend">So some time after my first Web Design class in 2018, I knew the writing on the wall for a new site to fulfill those very desires, and with a new site would inevitably mean a refresh of my portfolio. I wasn't in the search for a new job and I figured there wasn't anyone out there that needed to reach me through my site. So in late 2019, I decided to officially start the process. I cut ties with Weebly and had my hosting done through my Dad's AWS front. I gave the site a quick and dirty work-in-progress front in the meantime. I figured that by the time Web Design II came in 2020, it would all come together.</p>

			<p class="sectionend">2019 me didn't realize a few important variables, at least one of which was not entirely in his control. I'll describe them in order of least to most impactful.</p>

				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>The first problem was branding. The Paul Edmiston brand was entering a revision as early as 2018 for what was ultimately a simple reason: the US shades had to go.</p>
			<p>In my defense, for a while it had a personal value. Maybe that personal value was ultimately an inside joke based around a pair of sunglasses I bought at Six Flags back in 8th Grade, but I still say that's personal value. Either way, it was a simpler time where I used my personal brand on personal matters as well as more disconnected online material. It meant applying a generalist that was purposely more casual, even if in hindsight casual was more like tacky.</p>

				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>Looking back, I think part of me recognized the tackiness and even tried to find ways to nudge the logo towards a less tacky direction. At various points in time in high school, I experimented with variations. Yet at the time, no variation felt unique enough to stand on its own. In a way, for better or worse, the US shades leant a personal charm to the system.</p>
			<p>It was an experimentation that would continue for literally years, until I got around to recreating it from the ground up in 2019. It was great! Now I had my hands on a logo that felt like the best of both of my goals: sleek and sharp, yet retaining its character from a personal history of art.</p>
			<p>But then I realized it meant applying that update in branding to everywhere else.</p>
			<p>It's a simple problem, but one which can drag on for ages. The good thing about a robust branding system, even if it isn't formulated in a style guide, is that you have a robust plan and asset inventory to work with. The bad thing is that when you update it, it's a lot of work. A lot of work.</p>
			<p class="sectionend">So much work that it meant playing brand catch-up when a project came around for it. Drat!</p>

			<p>My second problem was one I didn't realize was a problem until I got into it: 2020. The COVID lockdown and its rippling ramifications throughout society.</p>
